# Primes

In this taks, we want to benchmark OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 vs Google's Gemini Advanced 1.5.

## The problem

To solve this problem, you are not allowed to use any external libraries. Also, you have to make this algorithm as fast as possible. The code has to be written in Python.

There is a sequence of numbers generated by the formula

    X(0) = 1
    X(n+1) = mod(2147483647*X(n)+137438953471, 1400) + 1

Your task is to take all prime numbers from the sequence X(1), ..., X(1E8) and sum them together. Note, we do not include X(0) in the series.

## Results - Round #1

This is the first round of test. Where, I, chatGPT and Gemini did not use the knowledge from each others.

### gemini_round_1.py

Gemini built an boolean array of length 1400.

Timing from 3 runs

### chatgpt_round_1.py

ChatGPT built a set of prime keys.

ChatGPT says

    "A key insight to optimize further is recognizing patterns or cycles within the sequence generated by the formula. Due to the modulo operation, the sequence might enter a cycle where the same numbers start repeating after a certain point. This would drastically reduce the number of unique values we need to check for primality.

    Let's refine our strategy with a focus on identifying a cycle within the sequence. If a cycle is detected, we can calculate the sum of primes within one cycle and then use this information to compute the total sum for all cycles up to X(100,000,000)X(100,000,000) without iterating through every single value.

    1) Detect a cycle: Modify the sequence generation to detect a cycle.
    2) Compute sum within the cycle: Once a cycle is detected, compute the sum of primes within that cycle.
    3) Extrapolate to the total sum: Calculate how many complete cycles fit into 100,000,000 iterations and sum accordingly."

However, CharGPT did not use it's own idea.

## Results - Round #2

We have been allowed to see each others code and from there make improvements.

### gemini_round_2.py

This time Gemini came up with the wrong answer and it was also slower.

Answer: 69799288914

    real    0m49.675s
    user    0m47.964s
    sys     0m1.704s

I then attempted to make Gemini use repeated cycles, as ChatGPT suggested, and it came up again with

    real    0m31.977s
    user    0m30.185s
    sys     0m1.785s

### chatgpt_round_2.py
